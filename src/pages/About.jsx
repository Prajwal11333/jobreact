          <p style={{lineHeight: '1.8', fontSize: '1.1rem', color: '#666'}}>
            AccessWork was founded in 2023 with a simple yet powerful idea: that everyone deserves the chance to build a meaningful career. Our founders, a diverse team of professionals with and without disabilities, recognized the barriers that existed in traditional job searching and decided to create something better.
          </p>
          <p style={{lineHeight: '1.8', fontSize: '1.1rem', color: '#666', marginTop: '1rem'}}>
            Today, we're proud to be India's leading inclusive job platform, connecting thousands of talented professionals with forward-thinking employers who value diversity and inclusion. Our platform goes beyond just job listings â€“ we provide the tools, resources, and community support needed for career success.
